					<p>When I was at college I had a lecturer who used to call me 'Butterfly Brain' because I seemingly had the ability to take in information and process it quickly before moving on to another topic much like a butterfly flitting from flower to flower.</p>

					<br/>

					<p>Even with this type of mind, I always did like to zone into a problem in depth and focus until I found a solution; this is probably what drew me to software development in the first place. But for a while now I have been noticing a drop in my concentration levels.</p>

					<br>

					<h2 class="post-title">What is the problem?</h2>

					<p>My job often requires me to have a complex application state in my mind, which is to say the values of various variables and parameters at any given time, plus the ability to think abstractly about things. Often times, particularly when I'm at home working on a pet project, I 'awake' to find that I've just spent X amount of minutes (or hours) surfing YouTube. 
					</p>
                    
                    <br/>
                    
                    <p>Fortunately I don't seem to have this problem when I'm with people, but I don't want it to become an issue; I often tell people the reason I love playing music and singing is that it's the only time in life where I'm truly present in the moment, and surely BEING in the moment is what life is all about? We are human BEINGS, not human DOINGS - A great quote which I can't remember where I heard it.</p>

					<br/>

					<h2 class="post-title">Why is this such a problem?</h2>

					<p>Aside from a reduction in productivty in work or in pet projects, I don't want to reach old age (assuming I am fortunate enough to make it to old age) and realise that I missed so much of life around me because I wasn't present. Which brings me to technology....</p>
                    
                    <br/>

					<p>I LOVE technology, that's why I work in the industry. But I have felt for a long time that smart phones are robbing the human race of many fundamental things. Maybe we're not supposed to be able to reach each other in an instant and know exactly where each other are, and actually see by way of blue ticks (I'm looking at you WhatsApp) if someone has read our messages. I'm not denying that technology and social media have given us many benefits; being able to stay in contact with friends around the world is a great thing, being able to see what's happening in other parts of the world is a great thing (ignoring the manipulation that goes on with careful editing of videos), but we have definitely lost a lot too.</p>
                    
                    <br/>
                    
                    <p>I deleted my Facebook account last December. It took me a while because I had a band page to maintain and also FOMO (fear of missing out). I suffered from a common problem which I read about, that people cherry pick the moments of their lives and post only those, curating a public image. The trouble is, with our natural human tendency to compare ourselves to others, it was too easy to think everyone else had a great life while mine sucked. </p>
                    
                    <br/>
                    
                    <p>Not only that but clearly with social platforms we tend to end up in a bubble by blocking/unfollowing/unfriending anyone whose opinions and ideas differ from ours. This is where the idea took hold that your feelings were more important than facts, which is ridiculous and dangerous. So you end up only reading things that you agree with, and being surrounded by (virtually) people whose opinion is the same as yours. You never see an opposing argument and if you do, you block them. Debate about the important things in life is how humans have always sought middle ground, and it's being eroded. If you speak out on social media with an opinion which is different, you are immediately hounded for being 'a nazi', 'right wing', 'sexist', 'racist', and 'scum'.</p>
                    
                    <br/>
                    
                    <h2 class="post-title">What's next?</h2>
                    
                    <p>I've followed some advice online and switched off notifications from all apps on my phone, except those where it's a person trying to reach me, like WhatsApp for example. This means no more notifications from Twitter to tell me I haven't tweeted in a while. I have moved all but my 6 most used apps into folders on a second screen which means I don't flick through my phone to open and close apps - yes it's been shown that people do that too! But it's not enough. I'm considering deleting Twitter. It can be useful for work, to find out new technologies, events, and so on, but it's tough to drown out the noise, so possibly I will trim down who I follow and only check it once a day. I'll likely keep Instragram, because photography is a passion on mine and I like to share photos.</p>
                    
                    <br/>
                    
                    <p>Aside from all that, I am hoping to (re)start Mindfulness Meditation as a way of calming the mind and being in the present moment. I want to enjoy my life and relish the time I have with those I share it with, not being elsewhere on a phone, reading the thoughts of strangers. My partner and I have a rule where we keep our phones in our pockets as much as possible when we're together. Of course we do sometimes open and app or take a photo, but I mean we don't ignore each other in order to spend time with people online. We do well with this and I hope it's something I can bring to other aspects of my life.</p>

					<br/>

					<p>I'd love to know if anyone else in my industry (or elsewhere) suffer from this problem and what they did to address it.</p>

					<br/>

					<p>Richard</p>
